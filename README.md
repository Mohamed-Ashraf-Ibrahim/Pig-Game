# Pig Game

Welcome to Pig Game v2! This is a web-based dice game where two players compete to reach a specified score and emerge as the winner.

## Gameplay

In Pig Game, players take turns rolling a dice:
- Rolling a 1 resets the player's current score to zero and passes the turn to the next player.
- Rolling any other number (2-6) adds that number to the player's current score.
- Players can choose to "Hold" their current score to add it to their total score and pass the turn to the next player.

The first player to reach the winning score (default is 100) wins the game.

## Features
